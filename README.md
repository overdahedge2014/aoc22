advent of code 2022 (going back to prior years to try and build a habit of daily attempts)

lessons learned:
**day 1:** can't remember lol. writing anything causes me to build more fundamentals especially when i've still barely used python  
**day 2:** got more familiar with logic keywords; `if x in y` notation is very nice  
**day 3:** first attempt at boilerplate use (just a function to do the file opening/splitting i had been doing every day, unsuccessful implementation though). splitting strings in half, need to learn what that array length notation actually means so i can use it in future  
**day 4:** regex and interactions with strings and ints; this day ended up mostly just being a bunch of logic though and pt2 was easier than pt1
